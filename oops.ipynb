    "Abstraction is used to reduce complexity and make it easier to work with complex systems.\n",

    "For example, consider a car. \n",
    "From a high-level perspective, we only need to know certain information about the car, such as its make, model, and year, its top speed, and its fuel efficiency.\n",
    "We don't need to know every little detail about how the car works, such as the size of the engine, the exact number of cylinders, or the individual torque values for each wheel.\n",
    "By focusing on the most important features of the car, we can create a simplified abstraction of the car that is easier to work with and understand.\n",

    "The class exposes a public interface, which can be used to interact with the object, while keeping the implementation details hidden.\n",
